# HeartCore
A hardcore death system, that reduces player max health on each death.

Features:
- Reduce max health of players on death
- Ban player if max health reaches zero
- Option to ignore player kills
- Player head drops on death
- CombatLog timer, that kills players on logout, if they have taken damage recently
- Commands to set maximum health of a player or get their head
- All features are configurable!

Coming soon:
- "rituals" to respawn players and refill their hearts
- Changes to regeneration (only reg up to half health, etc.)
